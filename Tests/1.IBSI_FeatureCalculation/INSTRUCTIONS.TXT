*******  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING IBSI TEST -- PHASE 1: Feature calculation *********
*************************************************************************************


1. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer by running "git clone https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics-develop.git" in the terminal. Enter your GitHub username and password.

2. Open MATLAB and set up the MATLAB path on your computer to include all "Code" sub-folders contained in "/radiomics-develop/" on your computer (this folder should stay where you cloned the GitHub directory on your computer, where frequent "git pull" should be performed in the terminal to conserve up-to-date code on your computer).

3. Run "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" in MATLAB. This script is found in "/radiomics-develop/Tests/IBSI_FeatureCalculation". Make sure the digital phantom "test.m" (also found in "/radiomics-develop/Tests/IBSI_FeatureCalculation") is located in the same folder as "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" when the script is run. Running this script will result in a new file "IBSIresults_FeatureCalculation.csv" created in the same folder that "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" is run.


*** It is recommended to run the script outside the GitHub repository on your computer.
